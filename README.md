### Installation and Setup Instructions
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Reflection
This project was part of our Edx Frontend web developemnt course project. We had to creat an app with following criteria
* Must use ReactJS.
* Must use Node.
* Must have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
* Must deploy this application using Netlify.
* Must utilize at least two libraries, packages, or technologies that we haven't discussed.
* Must have a polished front end/UI.
* Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

We decided as a team to build an Ecommerce site that could be used to integrate with other applications and future applications. 
Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing ourselves with documentation for new features, libraries etc.
Learning and applying two new libraries added to the challnge and was a great opportunity to delve further into the world of programming.
We had previously only worked on Github, so learning Netlify and using that for deployemnt was a great learning curve. 

The technologies implemented in this project are React, Nodesjs, Nextjs and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. We chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into the technological rabbit holes.
